# Data science questions

This website has a collections of questions about data science topics.  They are designed to be pretty short (more like something for a quiz or exam, less like a homework problem).  Have fun!

Repo is at https://github.com/jacksonloper/datasciencequestions (feel free to submit PRs!).  Also feel free to suggest a catchier name than "data science questions."

Here we use the notation that $\mathbb{P}$ denotes probability, $\mathbb{E}$ denotes expectation, and
$$\mathbb{I}(\mathrm{statement}) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \mathrm{if\ statement\ is\ true} \\
    0 & \mathrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$
