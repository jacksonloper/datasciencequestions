# Data science questions

https://jacksonloper.github.io/datasciencequestions/ is a collections of questions about data science topics, targeted towards the introductory masters level.  They are pretty short (more like something for a quiz or exam, less like a homework problem).  Maybe they will delight you.

Repo holding all the questions is at https://github.com/jacksonloper/datasciencequestions.  

If you have ever taken or taught a masters-or-higher data-science course, feel free to submit PRs or issues to the repo.  Please include your background when you do so I have a sense of where you're coming from.
